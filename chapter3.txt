**Whispers on the Wing**

In skies of dawn, the sparrows sing,  
Their melodies both soft and bright,  
They dance upon the morning’s wing,  
And vanish in the fading light.

The robins call from branch to tree,  
A song of hope, of day’s rebirth,  
Their voices blend in harmony,  
As morning breaks upon the earth.

The larks take flight in graceful arcs,  
They weave through clouds and sunlit beams,  
Their wings a canvas, tracing marks,  
Of whispered dreams and fleeting gleams.

The evening falls, the shadows play,  
The nightingale begins her tune,  
She sings of love that fades away,  
Beneath the silver, silent moon.
